Learning resources database
===========================

A collection of the most awesome tutorials/talks/screencasts/podcasts that teach programming

Contribute via twitter!
=======================
You can contribute by tweeting in this format:

`contribute @shecodes_ {link}`

where `{link}` is the link to the learning resource. (Shortend links are okay)

### Example
`contribite @shecodes_ www.crypto101.io`

## Add meta data
If you are even more awesome, add the twitter handle of the original author and – to make your tweet more readable – the title of the thing you add.

`contribute @shecodes_ {title} {link} @{author}`

### Example
`contribute @shecodes_ Stream handbook github.com/substack/stream-handbook @substack`

## Add hashtags

And if you want to go yet another step further towards insane awesomeness, include hashtags for media format, topic and donation model. See [below](#what-we-are-looking-for) for a number of hashtags that we recommend.

### Example
`contribute @shecodes_ Vimcasts vimcasts.org #vim #collection #screencast #donation @nelstrom`

Contribute via Github
======================
This document is a machine-readable database in markdown format. Please send us pull requests if you found a great tutorial that should be included. (Simply click [here](https://github.com/shecodes-students/learning-resources/edit/master/README.md) to edit in the convenience of your browser)

Who we are

Collections

If you want to link to a collection of resources (a podcast's home page, a blog, a coding school, a publisher of free text books), please include the #collection tag.

Free or payed-for content?
--------------------------
- if the content is free and the author has some way of receiving donations (flattr, gittip, ...) please add #donation
- if the content is partly free, please add the #freemium
- if the content is payed-for, please add #notfree

Additional tags
---------------
Feel free to add tags to describe the topic more accurately

The following only applies if you contribute via Github
=======================================================

Quality
-------
If the production quality is not the best, but the content is great, we still would like to hear about it. In such a case, you can add quality fields to the entry, rating audio and video quality from 1 (poor) to 5 (professional broadcast quality)

Language
--------
We are mainly interested in English-language resources. If however you find a non-English resource that is really good, please include it anyway and add the language field with a two-character language code (e.g. de, es, dk ..)

Author
------
If convenient, please add author field(s), indicating the mail-address, real name or twitter handle of the author. If the link to the resource goes to a GitHub repo, you don't need to specify an author because it can be determined automatically. Add one author field per author and separate different means of contacting by comma within the author field. *see examples below)
If the content is provided by a company rather than a person, put a company field instead of author fields.
